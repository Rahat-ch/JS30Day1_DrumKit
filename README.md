# JS30Day1_DrumKit

This is Day 1 of the Javascript 30 challenge from Wes Bos. My goal is to complete one of these exercises once a day for the next 30 days. 

For this project:

I created a simple drum kit by adding JavaScript to the starter files given. This consisted of using JS to match the key code of the letter we press to the data-key attached to each audio sound. If you press the correct key the corresponding audio sound will play. Some additional code was required to make sure you can repeatedly hit a button to play the sound instead of having some latency where the sound only plays once the full sound file is done playing. The second part of this was using javascript to add an animation to the selected key by adding a class of "playing" to the key for however many seconds the animation effect takes place. 

I learned a little more about some ES6 syntax, which is somehting I am still new to. Feel free to check out the deployed project below:
